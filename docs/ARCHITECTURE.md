# Reasonix Architecture

## Design philosophy

Reasonix is **opinionated, not general**. Every abstraction is justified by a
DeepSeek-specific behavior or economic property. If it's generic, we don't
ship it.

The product north star: **coding agent that stays cheap enough to leave on**.
A tool that quietly burns $200/month on a background project is one nobody
uses. Every subsystem below is answerable to that goal.

## The four pillars

### Pillar 1 — Cache-First Loop

**Problem.** DeepSeek bills cached input at ~10% of the miss rate. Automatic
prefix caching activates only when the *exact* byte prefix of the previous
request matches. Most agent loops reorder, rewrite, or inject fresh
timestamps each turn — cache hit rate in practice: <20%.

**Solution.** Partition the context into three regions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ IMMUTABLE PREFIX                        │ ← fixed for session
│   system + tool_specs + few_shots        │   cache hit candidate
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ APPEND-ONLY LOG                         │ ← grows monotonically
│   [assistant₁][tool₁][assistant₂]...    │   preserves prefix of prior turns
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ VOLATILE SCRATCH                        │ ← reset each turn
│   R1 thought, transient plan state      │   never sent upstream
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Invariants:**
1. Prefix is computed once per session, hashed, and pinned.
2. Log entries are serialized in append order; no rewrites.
3. Scratch is distilled via Pillar 2 before any information from it is folded
   into the log.

**Metric.** `prompt_cache_hit_tokens / (hit + miss)` exposed per-turn and
aggregated per-session. Visible in the TUI's top-bar cache cell.

#### Parallel tool dispatch

Each tool declares `parallelSafe?: boolean` (default `false`). The loop
dispatcher groups consecutive parallel-safe calls into chunks and races
them via `Promise.allSettled`; the first non-parallel-safe call ends the
chunk and runs alone (serial barrier — read-after-write order
preserved). Tool-result yields and history append still land in declared
order regardless of which call settles first, so the model sees the
same shape it would under a fully serial dispatch.

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MIMO_REASONIX_PARALLEL_MAX` | `3` (hard cap `16`) | Max chunk size. |
| `MIMO_REASONIX_TOOL_DISPATCH=serial` | unset | Forces serial dispatch — escape hatch. |

Built-in opt-ins: read-only filesystem (`read_file`, `list_directory`,
`directory_tree`, `search_files`, `search_content`, `get_file_info`),
web (`web_search`, `web_fetch`), `recall_memory`, `semantic_search`,
isolated child loops (`run_skill`, `spawn_subagent`), in-memory job
queries (`job_output`, `list_jobs`). Mutating / side-effecting tools
stay default. MCP-bridged tools default `false` — third-party tools
opt in only when the server explicitly declares parallel safety.

### Pillar 2 — Tool-Call Repair

**Problem.** Empirical DeepSeek failure modes:
- Tool-call JSON emitted inside `<think>`, missing from the final message.
- Arguments dropped when schema has >10 params or deeply nested objects.
- Same tool called repeatedly with identical args (call-storm).
- Truncated JSON due to `max_tokens` hit mid-structure.

**Solution.** Four passes:

1. **`flatten`** — schemas with >10 leaf params or depth >2 are auto-detected
   on `ToolRegistry.register()` and presented to the model in dot-notation
   form. `dispatch()` re-nests the args before calling the user's `fn`.
2. **`scavenge`** — regex + JSON parser sweeps `reasoning_content` for any tool
   call the model forgot to emit in `tool_calls`.
3. **`truncation`** — detect unbalanced JSON and repair by closing braces or
   requesting a continuation completion.
4. **`storm`** — identical `(tool, args)` tuple within a sliding window →
   suppress the call, inject a reflection turn.

### Pillar 3 — Cost Control *(v0.6)*

**Problem.** Coding agents that default to the frontier model (v4-pro, ~12×
flash cost) and accumulate full tool results in context are $150-$250/month
for active users. Most turns don't need frontier reasoning; most sessions
re-pay for tool results that were only useful once.

**Solution.** Four complementary mechanisms, none of which require manual
tuning in the common case:

#### 4.1 Tiered defaults (flash-first)

The three presets trade **model tier** and **reasoning effort**:

| Preset | Model | Effort | Cost |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `flash` | `v4-flash` | `max` | 1× |
| `auto` (default) | `v4-flash` → `v4-pro` on hard turns | `max` | 1–3× |
| `pro` | `v4-pro` | `max` | ~12× |

All auxiliary calls — `forceSummaryAfterIterLimit`, subagent spawns,
truncation repair retries — hard-code `v4-flash + effort=high` regardless
of the user's preset. There's no reason to pay pro rates for "paraphrase
these tool results into prose" or for an `explore` subagent's grep chain.

#### 4.2 Turn-end auto-compaction

Every tool result in the log exceeding `TURN_END_RESULT_CAP_TOKENS` (3000)
is shrunk to that cap when a turn ends. The model had the full text for
the turn that read it; subsequent turns see a compact summary and can
re-read if needed. One extra `read_file` call is vastly cheaper than
dragging 12KB through every future prompt.

A proactive 40% context-ratio threshold runs the same shrink pre-emptively
inside long multi-iter turns before the 80% emergency threshold fires.

#### 4.3 Model selection (`/model`)

Users switch between flash and pro via `/model flash` or `/model pro`
(persistent — applies to every turn until changed). Model can also be
set in `.reasonix/settings.json` under the `model` key. No one-shot
arming; no forgotten revert risk when switching is explicit and sticky.

> **History.** Pre-0.50.0, `/pro` offered single-turn arming — type `/pro`,
> the next turn ran on v4-pro then auto-disarmed. Removed in 0.50.0
> (#1657, #1630) when presets were collapsed into direct model selection.

#### 4.4 Model self-report escalation (`<<<NEEDS_PRO>>>`)

The model itself decides when a task exceeds its current tier. If a task
clearly needs stronger reasoning, the model emits a `<<<NEEDS_PRO>>>`
marker as the first line of its response. The system aborts the current
flash call and retries the turn on pro. Two forms:

- `<<<NEEDS_PRO>>>` — bare marker, no rationale.
- `<<<NEEDS_PRO: <reason>>>>` — includes a one-sentence rationale the
  user sees in a warning row.

On the pro tier, the marker is a no-op — pro is the top, so the contract
tells the model it can't escalate further. This is purely self-report:
there is no failure-counter threshold, no scavenge/storm counting, no
automatic escalation based on tool errors.

#### Cost transparency

Per-turn and session cost are colored in the StatsPanel:
- `turn $0.003` — green <$0.05, yellow $0.05–0.20, red ≥$0.20
- `session $0.12` — same scale ×10

```

Files kept small by design: the largest module under `cli/ui/` is 2K
lines (App.tsx), every handler under `slash/handlers/` is ≤200 lines,
every hook under `cli/ui/` is ≤310 lines. Adding a new slash command
means editing one handler file and one registry line.

## Design evolution

- **v0.0.x** — Pillar 1 end-to-end, repair pipeline complete, Ink TUI scaffold.
- **v0.1** — τ-bench numbers published, streaming polish, transcript replay.
- **v0.3** — MCP client (stdio + SSE), session persistence.
- **v0.4.x** — `mimo-reasonix code` with SEARCH/REPLACE edits, review/auto
  gate, background jobs, hooks.
- **v0.5.x** — V4 model support, skills, memory, subagents, actionable
  error messages.
- **v0.6** —
  - **Cost control** (flash-first defaults, auto-compaction, `/pro` one-shot,
    failure-triggered escalation, cost badges).
  - `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` scheduled for deprecation —
    all user-facing surfaces updated to `v4-flash` / `v4-pro`.
  - Shared prompt fragments (`TUI_FORMATTING_RULES`, `NEGATIVE_CLAIM_RULE`).
  - UI refactor: App.tsx split into 6 hooks/components, slash.ts split
    into 13 per-topic modules.
- **v0.31** *(current)* — `branch` + `harvest` features removed entirely
  (the parallel-sample selector and Pillar 2 plan-state extractor); both
  rarely paid for themselves and bloated the slash surface.

## Explicit non-goals

- Multi-agent orchestration as a first-class concept (subagents are a
  cost-reduction mechanism, not a coordination primitive).
- RAG / vector retrieval.
- Support for non-DeepSeek backends (an OpenAI-compatible shim would
  work today via `--model` override, but is not tested).
- Web UI / SaaS.
- Automatic cost escalation without user-visible announcement. Every
  pro-tier model call is surfaced; silent escalation was considered
  and rejected.
