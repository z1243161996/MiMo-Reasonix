  "- **Length cap: ≤ 80 lines / 3KB total.** Be concise. If you can't fit a",

  "1. Read the top of any existing README* file.",
  "2. Read the manifest (package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml /",
  "   go.mod / etc.) — pick whichever exists.",

  "   common build/dependency dirs (node_modules, dist, target, .git,",
  "   venv, __pycache__).",

  "   runner, lint/format setup, build/run/test scripts, any non-obvious",
  "   convention with visible evidence (commit message format, import",
  "   order, naming pattern).",

  "   fill from evidence.",

  "- **Stack** — language + framework + 3-5 key deps. One line each.",
  "- **Layout** — top-level dirs and what lives in each. One line each.",
  "- **Commands** — verbatim from `scripts` block (or equivalent):",
  "  build / test / lint / typecheck / dev / format. Whatever exists.",
  "- **Conventions** — only things visible in the code. Examples:",
  "  '*.test.ts colocated with source', 'named exports only',",
  "  'commits use Conventional Commits prefix'. If you can't find any",
  "  CONVENTION evidence, omit the whole section.",
  "- **Watch out for** — gotchas a new contributor would benefit from",
  "  knowing BEFORE editing. Examples: 'edit_file SEARCH must match",
  "  byte-for-byte', 'this dir is generated, don't edit by hand'.",
  "  Omit if you find nothing concrete.",
  "",
  "## Output",
  "",
  "Write the result to `MIMO_REASONIX.md` in the project root using the",
  "filesystem tools (edit_file with empty SEARCH if creating new,",
  "write_file if overwriting). After writing, STOP — do not summarize",
